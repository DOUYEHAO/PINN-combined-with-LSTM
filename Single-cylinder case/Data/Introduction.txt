Description
------
"data-single.mat" is the dataset used in a single-cylinder case. It includes the selected velocity distribution from 85s to 90s in the rectangular area, along with the corresponding temporal and spatial coordinates.
------
"CFD.7z" contains the global velocity distribution from 85s to 95s. If you want to conduct tests on other selected areas, you can extract the data using the relevant code.
 ------
"all-u.mat" and "all-v.mat" in the file "Coefficient of determination" are used to calculate the coefficient of determination.
 ------
"u-rmse.mat" and "v-rmse.mat"  in the file "RMSE" are used to calculate the variation curve of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) outside the dataset.
 ------
Due to the large size of the data, you need to generate the predicted data by using the relevant codes.
